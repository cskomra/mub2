# Multi User Blog

This multi user blog allows users to create a secure account in order to submit posts, add  comments, and like someone else's post.

### Basic functionality:
- A user must log in to post, comment, or like a post; but may read posts and comments without logging in.
- A user may create, edit, or delete his own post.
- A user may comment on her own post or another user's post.
- A user may "Like" another user's post, but not his own post.
- A user may only "Like" a post once.
